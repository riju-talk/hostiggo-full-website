            Hostiggo follows a standardized, platform-defined cancellation
            framework to ensure transparency, fairness, and consumer
            protection. While hosts may choose from available cancellation
            options, they are required to operate strictly within the policies
            defined and enforced by Hostiggo. Custom or self-defined
            cancellation rules are not permitted.
